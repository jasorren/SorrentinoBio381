# Question 1
n_dims <- sample(size=1,x=3:10) # random integer between 1 and 10
n_dims_vec <- seq(from=1,to=(n_dims)^2) # sequence of integers from 1 to the square of n_dims
shuf_vec <- sample(x=n_dims_vec,size=length(n_dims_vec),replace=FALSE) # vector of n_dims_vec values sampled randomly to reorder them
m <- matrix(data=shuf_vec,nrow=sqrt(length(shuf_vec))) # square matrix of the values in shuf_vec
print(m)
m <- t(m) # transpose matrix m
print(m)
sum(m[1,]) # sum of first row of m
mean(m[1,]) # mean of first row of m
sum(m[sqrt(length(shuf_vec)),]) # sum of last row of m
mean(m[sqrt(length(shuf_vec)),]) # mean of last row of m
m <- eigen(m) # calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of m
typeof(m$values) # data type of m$values is "complex"
typeof(m$vectors) # data type of m$vectors is "complex"

# Question 2
my_matrix <- matrix(data=runif(n=16),nrow=4) # square matrix of 16 random numbers
my_logical <- seq(1:100) # vector of integers 1 to 100
my_logical <- my_logical<50 # vector now displays whether or not the previous values were or were not less than 50
my_letters <- letters # vector of the lowercase alphabet
my_letters <- sample(x=letters,size=26,replace=FALSE) # random reordering of the previous vector values
my_list <- list(my_matrix,my_logical,my_letters) # list containing the previous matrix and two vectors
new_list <- list(my_matrix[2,2],my_logical[2],my_letters[2]) # new list with the 2nd row 2nd column value from the matrix, the 2nd position value from the first vector, and the 2nd position value from the second vector
typeof(new_list[[1]]) # data type of first list element is "double"
typeof(new_list[[2]]) # data type of second list element is "logical"
typeof(new_list[[3]]) # data type of third list element is "character"
new_vector <- c(new_list[[1]],new_list[[2]],new_list[[3]]) # concatenated vector made from the elements of the list
typeof(new_vector) # data type of this vector is "character"

# Question 3
my_unis <- runif(n=26,min=0,max=10) # 26 random values between 0 and 10
my_letters <- LETTERS # vector of the uppercase alphabet
my_letters <- sample(size=26,x=my_letters) # random reordering of my_letters
dFrame <- data.frame(my_unis,my_letters) # data frame composed of the previous two vectors
dFrame[sample(size=4,x=1:26),1] <- NA # replacement of four randomly sampled values from the first column of the data frame with the value NA
which(!complete.cases(dFrame)) # identification of which rows don't have no missing values
print(dFrame)
dFrame[order(dFrame$my_letters),] # ordering of the data frame based on the element my_letters
print(dFrame)
mean(dFrame[which(complete.cases(dFrame)),1]) # mean value of non-missing value elements of the first column of the data frame
